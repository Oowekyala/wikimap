# Wikimap : wikipedia graphing tool

Transform a wikipedia XML dump of articles into [GEXF graph format](), suitable for plotting with e.g. [Gephi](https://gephi.org/ "Gephi's homepage"). The graph is created in the following way:
* Each node represents an article
* Each edge (directed) represents a link from a wiki page to another page
* Edges are weighted according to the number of links that link the same articles
* Links pointing to an article which is not contained in the set of nodes are discarded

## Usage:

### Download Wikipedia articles

* Use [Wikipedia's export form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Export) to download the articles and categories that interest you. 
* Alternatively, this repo includes a perl script that fills out the form for you, and with which you can download the contents of a category and subcategories with depth as a parameter. You'll need a perl distribution, and the modules `Set::Light`, `Set::Scalar` and `WWW::Mechanize`, which you can [install from CPAN](http://www.cpan.org/modules/INSTALL.html). Example usage:
```shell
$ src/pageretriever.pl -o output.xml -d 1 Category:Formal_languages #Â Downloads the category and subcategories
Done downloading 411 articles from 11 Wikipedia categories
```

### Transform and process the graph
* You'll need a Scala interpreter for that to work. Transform the dump into GEXF with
```shell
$ src/XmlGraphMaker.scala -i <your xml dump> -o <your output file>
```
* Open the generated graph file with Gephi and process it as you like, then export your image for others to see!
